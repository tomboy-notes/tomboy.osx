Tomboy OSX
===========

Tomboy OSX is the implementation of Tomboy Notes on OSX devices. Tomboy OSX is built using the Tomboy.library.

Tomboy is a desktop note-taking application for Linux, Unix and Mac. Its very simple and easy to use, with the potential to help you organize ideas and information you deal with every day.

Have you ever felt the frustation at not being able to locate a website you wanted to check out, or find an email you found interesting or remember an idea about the direction of the political landscape in post-industrial Australia? Or are you one of the those desperate souls with home-made, buggy, or not-quite-perfect notes systems?

Time for Tomboy. We bet you'll be surprised at how well a little application can make life less cluttered and run more smoothly.
